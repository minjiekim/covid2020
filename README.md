# 2020 Covid Cases and Rates in US
## Introduction
In this lab, we use the Mapbox API to create two maps visualizing the 2020 covid cases and rates by counties in the US. One of the maps is a choropleth map that uses the rate of Covid cases per one thousand residents by county. Another map is a proportional point map of covid cases by county. We use data from the New York Times, 2018 ACS 5 year estimates, and the U.S. Census Bureau.
